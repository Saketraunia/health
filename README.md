###Health and Wellness Companion for Women Age 65+
Welcome to our Health and Wellness Companion project, designed especially for women aged 65 and above. Our goal is to empower you to lead a healthier and more fulfilling life by following some fundamental principles and practices.

Guiding Principles
Stay Active: Engage in regular physical activity to maintain vitality. Remember to take a 30-minute walk every day, boosting both your physical and mental well-being.

Blood Pressure Check: Set a daily reminder to check your blood pressure at 9:00 AM. Simply click on the "Done" button once you've completed the check.

Medicine Management: Take your prescribed medicines at the following times:

Morning Medicine: 10:00 AM
Afternoon Medicine: 2:00 PM
Medicine Reminder: 9:30 AM
Balanced Calorie Intake: Keep track of your calorie intake after each meal. Strive to consume calories within the range of 1600 to 2200 per day. You can track your calories and receive reminders about your intake.

Daily Task Completion
As you complete your daily tasks—checking your blood pressure, taking medicines, going for a walk, and tracking your calorie intake—you'll receive notifications acknowledging your efforts.

Once you successfully complete all your tasks for the day, you'll see a congratulatory message: "Congratulations! You've successfully completed all your tasks for the day."

Monthly Appointment Reminder
On the 28th day of each month, you'll receive a reminder to schedule your monthly appointment. After you've booked the appointment, click the "Done" button to acknowledge the reminder. You'll receive a message saying: "You have acknowledged your appointment reminder."

Weekly Achievement
Consistency is key! By consistently following the path of health and wellness for one week, you'll achieve a major milestone. After completing all tasks for a week, you'll receive a notification saying: "You've completed all tasks for the week. Great job!"

We're here to support you on your journey to better health and well-being. Remember, small steps lead to big transformations. Let's embark on this journey together!

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Your health and well-being are our top priorities.

Wishing you health, happiness, and vitality on this remarkable journey!

Sincerely,
[Your Project Development Team]
